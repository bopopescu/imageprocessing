# imageprocessing
character detection 
idea:-
  In a developing country(like in my country, Nepal), we don't know that the public buses even come or not in the pre-defined route.
  So, to solve this kind of situation if we were able to read the character from the tag which are attached to the public buses by 
  capturing the image from an standby camera through which we image_process it and send the data to the server with the time 
  when the bus reach the bus stop. So that, through our own mobile phone also we will be able to detect the buses and manage our time.
